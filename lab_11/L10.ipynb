    "A neural network is a non-linear computational model inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and learn from data. In its simplest form, a neural network consists of interconnected \"neurons\" organized in layers. Each neuron processes inputs to produce an output, which it transmits to the next layer, thus allowing the network to learn complex representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of a neural network are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neuron (Perceptron)**: The fundamental element of a neural network that calculates a linear combination of input features based on weights $w$ and bias $b$:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "$$ f(z) = max(z, 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sigmoid: This function takes a real number and compresses it into an interval between 0 and 1, so large negative numbers become 0, and large positive numbers become 1. It can also be used in binary classification to transform scores into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Softmax (for multi-class classification): This function is most often used to transform the scores corresponding to the classes into a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K}e^{z_j}} $$\n",

    "Neural networks are modeled as groups of neurons connected in an acyclic graph. In other words, the outputs of some neurons can become inputs for other neurons. Neural network models are often organized into layers of neurons. For standard neural networks, the most common type of layer is the **fully connected layer**, in which all neurons between two adjacent layers are connected to each other,\n",
    "and neurons within a single layer have no connections between them. We define three main types of layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data, with each node representing an input feature.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that learn to extract more complex features.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: Provides the final prediction, organized differently depending on the task (e.g., one node for binary classification or multiple nodes for multi-class classification).\n",

    "### Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer in the MLP is fully connected, meaning that each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using MLPs for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. General Concepts**\n",
    "In classification, the goal of the MLP is to divide the data into distinct classes. In the case of binary classification, the output layer will have a single neuron that uses the sigmoid activation function. Thus, the network's output represents the probability of class 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(y = 1 | \\mathbf{x}; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sigma(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ represents the class, $x$ are the network's input data, $\\theta$ are the model's parameters, $\\sigma$ represents the sigmoid function, and $a$ represents the **logits**, i.e., the output of the last neuron before applying the sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of multi-class classification, the network's output layer will have one neuron per class that uses the softmax activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) tries to find an optimal non-linear decision surface using the *training* data. Thus, through the training process, the model adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) to learn to correctly separate the training data into the corresponding classes. The goal is to obtain a model that can classify new data from a test set with the highest possible accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Splitting the Dataset**\n",
    "Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test subsets is an essential practice in training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training Set: The model uses this subset to adjust its parameters (weights and biases) during training. It usually represents the largest part of the data, around 60-70% of the total dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validation Set: This subset is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to adjust hyperparameters (such as the number of layers, number of neurons, etc.). The validation set does not directly influence the adjustment of the model's parameters but provides feedback to prevent overfitting and to optimize the model. It is usually around 10-20% of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test Set: After the model is trained and optimized using the validation set, the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The purpose of this subset is to provide an estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new and unknown data. It is usually around 10-20% of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Training the MLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal parameters (weights and biases) of the model during training, a loss function is defined that measures how well the network's predictions correspond to the actual labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the case of binary classification, the loss function used is **binary cross-entropy**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{BCELoss} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( y_i \\cdot \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\cdot \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- where N represents the total number of examples\n",
    "- $y_i$ is the real label (0 or 1)\n",
    "- $\\hat y_i$ is the probability predicted by the model for the positive class (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the loss function, an iterative optimization process such as **gradient descent** is usually used. This algorithm iteratively updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to ensure the loss function decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter update is performed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla_{\\theta} \\text{BCELoss}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- where α is the learning rate\n",
    "- $\\nabla_{\\theta} \\text{BCELoss}$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters and contains the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each parameter of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent can be applied in three main ways: **batch gradient descent**, **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**, and **mini-batch gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Batch gradient descent: The gradient is calculated using the entire training set at each update step.\n",
    "2. Stochastic gradient descent: The gradient is calculated and the parameters are updated for each example in the training set.\n",
    "3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: The dataset is divided into small subsets (mini-batches), and the gradient is calculated and the parameters are updated for each mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for training an MLP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass**: The input data is passed through the network layer by layer, from the input layer to the output layer. Each neuron calculates a linear combination of the inputs (the weighted sum of the inputs plus a bias term), applies an activation function, and passes the output on. This phase produces the network's prediction for a given set of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Calculation** (Loss Function): After the prediction is obtained, it is compared with the actual value (the true label).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backpropagation**: In this phase, the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each parameter of the model are calculated by propagating the derivatives from the output layer to the hidden layers using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Weight Update**: The weights are adjusted in the descending direction of the gradient using the gradient descent method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Testing the MLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the testing phase of an MLP, the goal is to evaluate its performance on new, unknown data that was not used in training or validation. In this stage, the model only performs the forward pass to make predictions, without modifying the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of binary classification, the obtained probability $p(y=1|x; \\theta)$ will be compared with a threshold to find the predicted class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\text{if } p(y=1|x; \\theta) < 0.5 \\text{ predict class 0} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{if } p(y=1|x; \\theta) \\geq 0.5 \\text{ predict class 1}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises in this lab, you will use a neural network to recognize two handwritten digits, 0 and 1, from images in the MNIST dataset. This is a binary classification task."
